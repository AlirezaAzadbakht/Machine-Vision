# Machine Vision course
### Shahid Beheshti University 
    Alireza Azadbakht | Alireza Javaheri
    
this course contains four main projects and one research:

## 1. Filters
in this project, we try to implement 3 main filters and transformations in machine vision and an implementation of convolution:
 SOBEL FILTER
& CANNY FILTER
& HOUGH TRANSFORMATION

## 2. sift algorithm
in this project , we implement scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) a feature detection algorithm .

## 3. Bag of Visual Words
in this project, we follow the steps in Wikipedia and toward data science post about BoVW to implement this method in object recognition
